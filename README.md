# minesweeper
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden “mines” or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighbouring mines in each field.  I have created a fully working version of the game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
